# Synth-TS2Vec

This repository contains the thesis implementation for Synth-TS2Vec. It is an extension of the code originally presented in the paper [TS2Vec: Towards Universal Representation of Time Series (AAAI-22)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10466). The original code was adapted and improved to enhance performance on classification tasks.
